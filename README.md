# üé® Color Sorting System Using Pneumatics

An Arduino-based color sorting project that identifies object colors using an RGB sensor and sorts them using a pneumatic piston mechanism. This compact and functional system combines mechanical design, sensor integration, and control logic for automation tasks.

## üß† Overview

This project was built as a collaborative effort to demonstrate real-time color detection and sorting using:

- **RGB Color Sensor**: Detects the intensity of Red, Green, and Blue.
- **Pneumatic Actuation**: Powered by a Directional Control Valve (DCV) to move objects.
- **Servo Motor & Arduino Uno**: Drives precise sorting decisions and motion.

## üî© Hardware Components

| Component            | Function                               |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Arduino Uno          | Central controller                     |
| TCS3200 Color Sensor | Measures RGB values of each ball       |
| Servo Motor          | Triggers pneumatic direction control   |
| DCV (Valve)          | Controls compressed air for sorting    |
| Air Tank + Pipes     | Provides pneumatic actuation           |
| Wooden/Aluminum Frame| Physical structure and ball chute      |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **A colored ball** is dropped into the sensor chamber.
2. The **RGB sensor** reads color intensities.
3. Based on the result, a signal is sent to the servo or valve.
4. The **pneumatic actuator** sorts the ball into the appropriate bin.
